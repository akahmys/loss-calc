# Loss Calc Architecture & System Design

System architecture and module structure for **Loss Calc**.

---

## 1. Design Principles

1. **Decoupled Calculation Logic & Rendering**:
   - Fluid calculation engines (Darcy-Weisbach / Hazen-Williams) and pump spec calculations reside in pure TypeScript modules (`src/core/calc/`) without dependencies on Three.js or React UI.
2. **Unidirectional Data Flow**:
   - User inputs / 3D editor actions -> State Management -> Calculation Engine -> Update 3D Canvas & Calculation Report UI.
3. **Transparent Data Structures**:
   - Piping nodes, elements (pipes, elbows, valves, pumps), and system parameters are strictly defined with TypeScript interfaces.

## 3. Calculation Engine Specifications (`src/core/calc/`)

- **Pipe Friction Loss Calculation**:
  - Darcy-Weisbach equation: \(h_f = f \cdot \frac{L}{D} \cdot \frac{v^2}{2g}\) (friction factor \(f\) derived via Swamee-Jain or Colebrook-White equation)
  - Hazen-Williams equation: \(h_f = 10.666 \cdot C^{-1.85} \cdot D^{-4.87} \cdot Q^{1.85} \cdot L\)
- **Minor Loss Calculation**:
  - Fitting losses (elbows, tees, reducers) and valve losses calculated via equivalent pipe length \(L_e\) or loss coefficient \(K\).
- **Pump Specification Calculation**:
  - Total head \(H = H_a + h_f + h_o + H_v\) (Static head + Total friction loss + Margin + Pressure/Suction head adjustment)
  - Shaft power \(P = \frac{\rho \cdot g \cdot Q \cdot H}{60 \cdot \eta}\)

Dependencies flow strictly downward. `fepdf-render` is the one arrow that points *up*
into `fepdf-content`, because it implements a contract defined there — that is Rule B
working as intended, not a cycle.

## 🧩 3. Crate Responsibilities

Status: **✅** exists as-is · **⚠️** partially landed · **🔄** code exists, lives elsewhere today · **🆕** new.

| Crate | Status | ~Lines | Responsibility |
| :--- | :---: | ---: | :--- |
| **`fepdf-syntax`** | 🔄 in core (Audited ✅) | 1,200 | Bytes ⇄ raw objects. Lexing, parsing, stream filters, encryption/decryption. Hardened with recursion limits (`512`), line continuation, Zip Bomb limit (`128MB`), and AES key checks. |
| **`fepdf-font`** | 🔄 in core (Audited ✅) | 3,500 | Font *programs*: CFF, TrueType, CMap, Adobe Glyph List, subsetting, reconstruction. Hardened against W/W2 out-of-bounds, CMap underflows (`e_val >= s_val`), and CID byte truncations. |
| **`fepdf-model`** | 🔄 in core+sdk (Audited ✅) | 8,600 | The document graph: `PdfArena`, `Handle<T>`, `Object`, page tree, metadata. Hardened with pool overflow guards, cyclic `resolve` limits (`64`), and safe `Null` reference fallbacks. |
| **`fepdf-resource`** | 🔄 in core | 3,600 | Turns PDF resource dictionaries into usable resources: font dict → `FontResource`, colour spaces, images. The bridge between `fepdf-model` and `fepdf-font`. |
| **`fepdf-content`** | ⚠️ partial | 2,300 | Content-stream interpreter, and the **`RenderBackend` contract** it drives (`TextGlyph`, `TextState`, `SMaskData`, path geometry). No GPU dependency. *The contract has landed; the interpreter still lives in `fepdf-sdk`.* |
| **`fepdf-doc`** | 🔄 in sdk | 2,200 | Owns the **`Operation` vocabulary** (§5.1) and is its only interpreter: merge, split, rotate, tag, redact, upgrade. Also structure-tree handling, conformance auditing, remediation. |
| **`fepdf-render`** | ✅ | 1,100 | A `RenderBackend` implementation on **Vello** + **wgpu**. Reached only through the SDK's optional `render` feature. |
| **`fepdf`** | 🆕 | — | The public facade. `Document`, `Page`, `SaveOptions`, and the re-exported `Operation`. The Rule A boundary. |
| **`fepdf-cli`** | ✅ | 1,400 | Command-line binary (`fepdf`). |
| **`fepdf-gui`** | ✅ | 8,000 | Desktop application on **egui** + **eframe** + **wgpu**. |
| **`fepdf-mcp`** | ✅ | 340 | Model Context Protocol server for AI assistants. |
| **`fepdf-wasm`** | ✅ | 40 | WebAssembly bindings. Currently a stub — `render_page` is unimplemented. |
| **`fepdf-macros`** | ✅ | 160 | Compile-time procedural macros. |

Two `Backend` implementations besides the GPU one — text extraction and geometry
collection — live in `fepdf-doc`, which is exactly what Rule B makes possible.

## 🔬 4. Why This Shape

The layering is not a taxonomy exercise. Each boundary was placed where the current
tree already shows a seam or a defect.

**The font split is measured, not assumed.** Of 6,590 lines under `font/`, **3,547
reference no PDF type at all** — `agl`, `cff_standard`, `cmap`, `reconstruction`,
`rescue`, `subset` are pure font-format work. The remaining 3,043 exist solely to
read font dictionaries, which is why they become `fepdf-resource` rather than moving
with the rest.

**The contract/implementation inversion had a concrete cost.** `RenderBackend` was
defined in `fepdf-render`, yet two of its three implementations lived in `fepdf-sdk`.
The SDK therefore depended on the GPU crate to obtain a trait definition, and every
SDK consumer inherited `vello` + `wgpu` transitively.

Rule B does not make that dependency *disappear* — it makes it **opt-in**. `fepdf-cli`
and `fepdf-mcp` both call `render_page_to_file` and genuinely rasterise, so they
enable the SDK's `render` feature and still link the GPU stack, correctly. What
changes is that the choice is now explicit: `fepdf-wasm`, which never rasterises,
went from three transitive GPU dependencies to none.

**Rule A exists because it was already broken.** `PdfArena` currently reaches
`fepdf-gui` (9 references) and `fepdf-cli` (2). The GUI worker holds struct-tree
traversal, `/BBox` interpretation and `/Pg` inheritance — PDF semantics living in the
presentation layer, outside the reach of engine tests. A page-mapping defect survived
there precisely because of that.

**Rule C exists because the round trip is currently split.** Ingestion sits in
`fepdf-core`; `writer.rs` — the single largest file in the workspace at 2,536 lines —
sits in `fepdf-sdk`. The engine can read but not write.

**Rule D exists because the vocabularies have already diverged.** "Rotate" is defined
twice — once as a clap subcommand, once as a `WorkerRequest` variant — and the two
disagree:

```rust
// fepdf-cli  handle_rotate()            — absolute assignment
doc.set_page_rotation(idx, angle)

// fepdf-gui  WorkerRequest::RotatePages — relative delta, normalised
doc.set_page_rotation(idx, (current + delta).rem_euclid(360))
```

On a page already at 90°, `fepdf edit rotate --angle 90` leaves it at 90° while the
GUI's 90° button takes it to 180°. The CLI's own progress message says "rotating **by**
N degrees", describing the behaviour it does not have. Neither path normalises, so
`--angle 45` reaches `/Rotate`, which ISO 32000-2 requires to be a multiple of 90.

Nothing detected this, because there is no place where the two definitions meet.

## 🛡️ 5. Cross-Cutting Concerns

### 5.1 The operation vocabulary

Every document mutation is a value of one type, defined in `fepdf-doc` and re-exported
through the facade. Frontends construct it; only `fepdf-doc` interprets it.

```
   fepdf-cli    argv          ─┐
   fepdf-gui    button press  ─┤
   fepdf-mcp    tool call     ─┼─►  Operation  ─►  fepdf-doc::apply
   fepdf-wasm   JS call       ─┘     (a value)      (the only implementation)
```

Ambiguity that used to live in prose becomes a type. The rotate divergence above is
not fixable by convention; it is fixable by making the choice unrepresentable:

```rust
pub enum Operation {
    // --- Core Page & Structure Operations ---
    Rotate { pages: PageSelection, mode: RotateMode },
    Reorder { from: usize, to: usize },
    RemovePages(PageSelection),
    InsertFrom { source: DocumentId, at: usize },
    Retag { .. },
    Redact { zones: Vec<RedactionZone> },
    Upgrade { standard: PdfStandard },

    // --- Metadata & Structure Domain ---
    CreatePortfolio { items: Vec<PortfolioInputItem>, cover_page: Option<CoverPageSpec> },
    UpdateOutlines { items: Vec<OutlineNodeSpec> },
    CreateLayer { name: String, visible_by_default: bool, printable: bool },
    SetLayerVisibility { layer_id: String, visible: bool },
    AttachAssociatedFile { target: TargetObjectRef, file_name: String, mime_type: String, bytes: Vec<u8> },
    SetOutputIntent { subtype: String, identifier: String, icc_profile_bytes: Option<Vec<u8>> },
    SetPronunciationLexicon { lexicon_xml_bytes: Vec<u8> },

    // --- Security & Provenance Domain ---
    VerifyDigitalSignature { field_name: String },

    // --- Decorations & Annotations Domain ---
    AddHyperlink { page: usize, rect: [f32; 4], destination: LinkDestination },
    AddPageDecorations { header: Option<String>, footer: Option<String>, watermark: Option<WatermarkSpec> },
    ApplyBatesNumbering { prefix: String, start_number: u64, digits: usize, position: PagePosition },
    AddAnnotation { page: usize, annotation: AnnotationSpec },
    AddStamp { page: usize, rect: [f32; 4], stamp_image_bytes: Vec<u8> },
    SetMeasurementScale { page: usize, scale_ratio: f32, unit_label: String },

    // --- Interactive Forms Domain ---
    SetFormFieldValue { field_name: String, value: FormValue },
}

pub enum RotateMode {
    /// Set `/Rotate` to this angle. Rejected unless a multiple of 90.
    Absolute(Quarter),
    /// Add to the current angle, normalised into [0, 360).
    Relative(Quarter),
}
```

A caller must now say which it means, and `Quarter` makes 45° unconstructible.

**Three consequences fall out rather than being designed in:**

- **Undo/redo.** Operations are values, so they can be recorded, inverted and
  replayed. The GUI gets history without a parallel mechanism.
- **MCP tool surface.** A tool becomes the serialised form of an `Operation`. New
  operations reach AI assistants without new bridging code.
- **Testability.** An operation sequence can be applied and asserted without starting
  a GUI or spawning a process.

**What this is not.** The GUI keeps its worker thread: `WorkerRequest` remains, but as
a thin envelope (`Execute(Operation)`, plus genuinely GUI-only messages such as
`RenderPage`). Off-thread execution is a GUI concern; the *meaning* of an operation is
not. Equally, this is not "the GUI drives the CLI as a subprocess" — the GUI is a
stateful editor holding an arena, retained scenes and per-page spans in memory, and
re-ingesting a 5,057-page document per interaction is not viable. Shared vocabulary,
not a shared process.

### 5.2 The Sublimation Pipeline: normalisation-at-load

Every byte passes three normalisation stages before application code sees it. The
pipeline spans `fepdf-syntax` → `fepdf-model`, which is why normalisation is a
concern of the model rather than a crate of its own.

```
Raw bytes ─► Pass 0: Physical ─► Pass 1: Arena ─► Pass 2: Semantic ─► Document
```

- **Pass 0 — Physical normalisation.** Recursive stack-based decryption and
  cross-reference repair. Strips residual `/Encrypt` dictionaries for deterministic
  reader compatibility.
- **Pass 1 — Arena ingestion.** Expands object streams (`/ObjStm`), stores objects in
  `PdfArena` under deterministic `Handle<Object>` (id + generation), and indexes
  resource dictionaries, `/Collection` portfolios, `/OCProperties` layers, `/AF` associated files, and `/Outlines`.
- **Pass 2 — Semantic sublimation.** Re-encodes character mappings to eliminate legacy
  CJK mojibake, preserves exact path endpoints (`EndPath n`), harmonises graphics
  state, normalises colour, and validates PDF 2.0 structure integrity.

### 5.3 Unified Extension Architecture (Anti-Ad-Hoc Policy)

To prevent codebase drift, ad-hoc struct additions, or uncoordinated writer logic, all new backend capabilities MUST fit into one of four orthogonal domain namespaces owned by `fepdf-model` / `fepdf-doc`:

1. **Metadata & Structure**: Portfolio (`/Collection`), Outlines (`/Outlines`), Optional Content (`/OCProperties`), Associated Files (`/AF`), Output Intents (`/OutputIntents`), Pronunciation (`/PL`).
2. **Security & Provenance**: Crypt Revision 6 (AES-256-GCM), PKI PAdES Digital Signatures, Sublimation/Redaction.
3. **Decorations & Annotations**: Watermarks, Bates Numbering, Hyperlinks (`/Link`), Stamps, Measurements (`/Measure`).
4. **Interactive Forms**: AcroForms, FDF/XFDF static data models.

No feature is permitted to bypass the `Operation` vocabulary or inject un-audited dictionary mutations directly into frontends or serialisers.

#### 5.3.1 Multi-Format Provider Architecture
When introducing support for external document formats (e.g., Word `.docx`, Excel `.xlsx`, SVG, HTML), each format MUST follow Rule C by encapsulating its ingestion (reading) and emission (writing) within a dedicated format provider module/crate (e.g., `fepdf-import-docx`). Providers translate external formats into the `Operation` vocabulary or intermediate layout structures without exposing format-specific dependencies to `fepdf-core`.

### 5.4 Safety invariants

- **Handles, not pointers.** Objects are reached only through `Handle<Object>`,
  eliminating use-after-free and dangling references by construction.
- **Deterministic traversal.** `PdfArena` uses `BTreeMap` and indexed handle arrays
  throughout, so iteration order — and therefore produced bytes — is reproducible.
  RR-15 Rule 10 forbids `HashMap`/`HashSet` in the crates that decide output.
- **Zero unsafe.** `unsafe_code = "forbid"` across the workspace.

### 5.4 Rendering

`fepdf-content` walks the content stream and issues calls against `Backend`.
`fepdf-render` answers them with **Vello** compute shaders on **wgpu**. Path snapping
keeps double-precision `kurbo` geometry until rasterisation; `skrifa` and `read-fonts`
handle glyph mapping, Japanese fallback fonts, and Type 3 precipitation.

Because the contract is separate, the same interpreter drives text extraction and
geometry collection without a GPU present.

## 🚧 6. Migration

Ordered by value against risk. Steps 1–3 and 5 relocate code without changing logic,
so a green test run is sufficient evidence of correctness. Steps 0, 4 and 6 change
behaviour or API and need their own tests.

| # | Step | Effect | Risk |
| :-: | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| 0 | Reconcile the two `rotate` implementations | Fixes a live behavioural divergence; independent of everything below | Low |
| 1 | Move the `RenderBackend` contract and its types from `fepdf-render` into `fepdf-content` | ✅ **Done.** GPU became opt-in; WASM dropped to zero GPU dependencies | Low |
| 2 | Extract the PDF-free half of `font/` into `fepdf-font` | 3,500 lines become independently testable | Low |
| 3 | Move struct-tree handling out of `fepdf-gui` into `fepdf-doc` | Domain logic returns to the engine; closes the Rule A leak | Medium |
| 4 | Introduce `Operation` in `fepdf-doc`; reduce the CLI subcommands and `WorkerRequest` to adapters over it | Rule D becomes structural; divergence stops being possible | Medium |
| 5 | Move `writer` into `fepdf-model` (core) | ✅ **Done.** Restores the read/write round trip in `fepdf-core` (Rule C); `fepdf-sdk` re-exports for compatibility | Low |
| 6 | Introduce the `fepdf` facade | Rule A becomes enforceable; touches all four frontends | High |

Step 0 is a bug fix and needs no restructuring — but do it as part of step 4, not
before it, or the same divergence simply recurs the next time an operation is added.

Steps 3 and 4 belong together: both pull domain decisions out of the presentation
layer, and step 4 is what stops them leaking back.

Step 6 delivers most of the usability gain and should follow 1–5, not precede them.
The current API cannot hide its internals — reaching a catalogue requires
`doc.inner().catalog_handle()`, which is the symptom the facade removes.

**Deliberately not planned.** Splitting `fepdf-doc` into separate operation and
verification crates: auditing and remediation act on the same document surface, so
module boundaries suffice until that changes. Treating `fepdf-wasm` as a peer
frontend: at 40 lines with an unimplemented renderer, whether to build it is a product
decision, not an architectural one.

---

## 🔍 7. Enforcement

Architecture rules that are not checked become comments. These are:

- **Rules A–C**: crate dependency direction is enforced by Cargo itself once the split
  lands — a violation fails to compile.
- **Rule D**: enforced by construction, not by review. Once mutations exist only as
  `Operation` values and `fepdf-doc` holds the only `apply`, a frontend has nothing to
  re-implement. The rule is worth stating because that property is easy to give away:
  the moment a frontend calls a mutating method directly instead of building an
  `Operation`, drift becomes possible again.
- **RR-15 protocol**: [`CODING.md`](CODING.md), checked by
  [`scripts/audit/verify_compliance.sh`](scripts/audit/verify_compliance.sh).
- **Lints**: `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`. `--all-targets`
  is required — without it tests, examples and benches go unlinted.
- **Licences**: `cargo deny check licenses` ([`deny.toml`](deny.toml)).
- **Secrets and PII**: `betterleaks` pre-commit hook ([`.betterleaks.toml`](.betterleaks.toml)).

Governance sits in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md), [`CODING.md`](CODING.md),
[`AUDITING.md`](AUDITING.md), and [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md).
